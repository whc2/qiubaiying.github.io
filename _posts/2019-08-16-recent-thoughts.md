DaNiu, a person who did great works and had great contribution to a field, is 
everybody's pursuit. So in order to become future DaNius, many folks want to 
work with them. This certainly promote one's opportunities to success, because
DaNius usually have more resources, no matter it be relationship or materials.
People who work closely with DaNius are more likely to get funds from the 
authority than those who don't. In this sense, doing one's best to approach 
DaNius are human natures.

However, why DaNius have the senior status is a more important point. Before 
they become a DaNiu, they usually work hard for a very long time. And thanks 
for this time, their works make a difference and then they become a DaNiu.

For me, I would like to become a DaNiu by myself. Think hard and do more.
